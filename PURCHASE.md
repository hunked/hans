Information about purchasing a prebuilt Hans is incoming.

Please note I am only offering to source the parts and assemble the device for you and it carries no additional warranty beyond your initial receiption.
After that point I am more than happy to assist you in diagnosing or repairing any issues yourself. 

Hans is an open source project with self-service in mind; ideally you will build a Hans yourself and be able to diagnose any hardware issues that arise. 
If you discover a bug please report it and I will fix it ASAP!
