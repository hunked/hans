This is a continuation of a couple of previous projects of mine [1](https://github.com/hunked/eightbuttonMIDIfootswitch)[2](https://github.com/hunked/footie). My goal is to make a durable, 3D printed, battery powered, MIDI footswitch that outputs over USB and 5 pin MIDI that can be assembled from cheap parts available to anyone. Why did I name it Hans? No good reason at all.

Hans has the following hardware/features:
- 5 momentary foot switches with status LEDs
- 1 external footswitch input for acting as a "shift" button (with small backup shift button on the back in case an external switch is not attached)
- 5 virtual "banks" of buttons that can be switched between while holding shift+the left most or right most button
- USB-C charging with an 18650 on board for portable power
- USB (mini) and 5-pin MIDI cable connections for MIDI data
- [Teensy 2.0++](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html) brains running at a blazing 16Mhz
- a 4 character screen

When Hans is turned on you can choose between three modes: 
- send MIDI on/off messages (either momentary or toggle operation)
- send MIDI control change (CC) messages
- send MIDI program change (PC) messages

I will soon be adding a fourth mode that will allow editing of ALL values (notes, velocities, channels, default mode, timeout lengths, etc).

I will also add some updated pictures with a final build, neat wiring, and build instructions to go with them. In the meantime I have a list of parts needed (on top of the 3D printed bits - which can be found on the thingiverse page).
